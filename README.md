# Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 using OpenAI APIs

This guide will walk you through the process of fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model with your specific data using OpenAI APIs.

## Prerequisites

1. An OpenAI API key: Sign up for an account on [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup) and obtain your API key.
2. Python: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed.
3. `openai` Python library: Install the OpenAI Python library with the command `pip install openai`.

## Steps to Fine-tune GPT-3.5

### 1. Prepare your dataset

Your dataset should be in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object. The object should have a `prompt` and a `completion` field.

Example:

```json
{"prompt": "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'", "completion": "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va ?"}
{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "completion": "Paris"}

Save your dataset in two separate files: train.jsonl for training and validation.jsonl for validation.

### 2. Upload your dataset
To upload your dataset to OpenAI, use the following Python script:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

with open("train.jsonl") as f:
    train_dataset = openai.Dataset.create(file=f, purpose="fine-tuning")

with open("validation.jsonl") as f:
    validation_dataset = openai.Dataset.create(file=f, purpose="validation")
