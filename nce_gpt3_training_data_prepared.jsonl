For example, high art often has a level of complexity and depth that low art may lack.\n\n### Input:\nI can see where you're coming from, but I still think that the distinction between 'high' and 'low' art is ultimately subjective.

But do you think it could be useful in everyday decision-making as well?\n\n### Input:\nDefinitely! Understanding the opportunity cost of a decision can help you make more informed choices in your personal life too. For instance, if you have a specific amount of money to spend and two things you want to buy, understanding the opportunity cost of each purchase will help you make a more informed decision.\n\n### Response:\n I see. But could you provide an example?\n\n### Input:\nSure thing. Let's say you have $50 to spare, and you can either buy a new software for $20, or a locally made all-natural soap for $10. You'll need to weigh out which option will provide you with greater value. In this case, if you're a software engineer, chances are that the software is much more valuable to you, so you might choose to buy that instead.\n\n### Response:\n I get it. So, if I understand this correctly, opportunity cost helps to highlight the value of the next best alternative that you can forego by choosing a specific option?\n\n### Input:\nAbsolutely! It helps to take into account the inherent value of that which can't be done as a result of a specific decision. In other words, opportunity cost is the cost of the alternative that must be opted out of when selecting a certain option.\n\n### Response:\n","completion":" That's very useful information.
